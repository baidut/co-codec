This software is a complete implementation of ITU T.81 - ISO/IEC 10918,
also known as JPEG. It implements the standard in all its variations,
including lossless coding, hierarchical coding, arithmetic coding and
DNL, restart markers and 12bpp coding.

In addition, it includes support for new proposed JPEG technologies that
are currently under discussion in the SC29/WG1 standardization group of
the ISO (also known as JPEG). These technologies include lossless coding
of JPEG backwards compatible to the DCT process, and various other
extensions.

The author is a long-term member of the JPEG committee and it is hoped that
this implementation will trigger and facilitate the future development of
the JPEG standard, both for private use, industrial applications and within
the committee itself.
