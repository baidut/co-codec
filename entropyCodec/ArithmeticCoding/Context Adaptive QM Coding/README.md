Context Adaptive QM Coding

This file takes as input binary data (image, text, audio etc.), reads the data bit by bit and encodes
the data using Context Adaptive QM Coding.

It can also do some bitmap preprocessing on the input file to make the data more amenable to compression.

To execute this file, simply run CABAC.cpp and follow instructions on the screen.
